Applying NLP to understand people's sentiment about Covid-19 and Government actions in Italy conditional on their political affiliation.

After web-scraping over 150k Italian tweets about Covid-19 reaction in the week from 10th to 16th March 2020, I cleaned the data and applied NLP techniques. The data were collected in such a way to account for the different political affiliation of people in Italy. 

I uploaded both the uncleaned and cleaned datasets in the Excel format as well as the code I wrote to clean and filter the data.
